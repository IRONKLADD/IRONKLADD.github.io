# Kenny's Board
I worked a lot on codecademy's JavaScript tutorial before writing up my board. As a result, I was unable to finish and post it as quickly as my my partners, but I also really had a good understanding of the code I was writing. Right now my board displays in a text grid format where colors are represented by text. I plan on making my board better over time until we start our main project.
